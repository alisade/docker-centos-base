# From-scratch CentOS 4.9 Docker image

As-minimal-as-possible CentOS 4.9 image using `yum` and some `chroot` magic.
The idea of checking in a large, opaque binary file makes me itch, but the
Docker model doesn't currently allow for more control over image creation.  This
is hopefully the only time I'll have to do thisâ€¦

Ok, this also contains the [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) repo
configs.  But it's still pretty minimal.

Even so, it's too big to put into GitHub:

    remote: error: GH001: Large files detected.
    remote: error: Trace: 12b8141feda3e55a3296427b879875da
    remote: error: See http://git.io/iEPt8g for more information.
    remote: error: File centos49.tar.xz is 134.86 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100 MB

So, no automated builds.

## generating filesystem image

    docker run --privileged -i -t -v $PWD:/srv centos:centos6 /srv/build.sh

## machine architecture

Image archive filename contains architecture name now.
If you build your image on i386 machine(docker container), this script build centos4-32bit image.
I have only x86_64 and i686 machine, so I couldn't check on alpha, ia64, s390(x).
